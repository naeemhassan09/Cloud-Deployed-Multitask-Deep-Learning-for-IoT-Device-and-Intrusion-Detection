Securing Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems continues to be a significant challenge because connected devices are very vulnerable to cyber attacks, as they are so different and have limited resources. This study suggests a cloud-based multitask deep learning framework that can identify IoT devices and detect intrusions at the same time. This improves detection efficiency and reduces the amount of computing power needed.
The suggested model uses a shared encoder to combine convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer layers to capture both spatial and sequential traffic features.
The CIC IoT-IDAD 2024 data set is used to train and test it, and is compared to single-task baselines such as XGBoost, TabNet, and BiLSTM. The framework is set up as a containerized FastAPI micro-service that runs on Docker and AWS ECS. It also has built-in CI/CD automation to make it more reliable and scalable. Experimental results show that the multitask model works better than single-task models in terms of accuracy and inference speed. This shows that it can be used in real-time IoT network protection. This research presents a deployable and efficient architecture that integrates model performance, scalability, and operational transparency for the security of IoT environments.
