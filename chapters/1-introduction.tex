\section{Background and Motivation}

\subsection{The IoT Landscape and Security Challenges}
By 2025, more than 75~billion Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to be active globally, spanning smart homes, healthcare systems, industrial automation, and critical infrastructure \parencite{Laghari2024}. This explosive growth represents one of the largest technological transitions in networked computing, shifting control from centralised servers to decentralised devices operating in dynamic, often unsecured environments.

IoT ecosystems differ sharply from traditional enterprise networks: they integrate diverse devices with heterogeneous hardware, protocols, and firmware designs. Such heterogeneity limits standardisation and complicates unified security policies. The distributed nature of IoT infrastructure, often combined with limited update mechanisms and exposure to public networks, significantly expands the potential attack surface.
\vspace{0.2cm}
Cyberattacks against IoT deployments have increased in both frequency and sophistication. Common vectors include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), botnet infiltration, spoofing, ransomware, and data exfiltration attacks exploiting weak authentication or firmware vulnerabilities \parencite{Nazir2025, Patil2025}. Historical events such as the 2016 Mirai botnet attack, which compromised more than 600,000 consumer devices, revealed the cascading risks posed by poorly secured IoT nodes. Recent research indicates that attackers are adopting zero-day exploits and adaptive malware that leverage device-specific behaviours for persistence within IoT networks.
\vspace{0.2cm}
The consequences of IoT security breaches extend beyond data loss or system downtime. Compromised industrial controllers or medical sensors may directly endanger physical safety. Regulatory non-compliance under frameworks such as GDPR or CCPA can incur severe financial penalties, while reputational damage may lead to lasting business impact. The convergence of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) further amplifies the risk, as insecure IoT endpoints often act as entry points into broader enterprise networks.

\subsection{Limits of Traditional Intrusion Detection}
Signature-based intrusion detection remains the dominant security mechanism in conventional IT environments. These systems identify attacks by matching observed traffic patterns to known signatures. However, they fail when confronted with novel or polymorphic malware. Updating large rule sets in real time is computationally prohibitive for most IoT gateways or edge nodes. The diversity of communication protocols—ranging from MQTT and CoAP to Zigbee, LoRaWAN, and BLE—renders universal rule coverage unrealistic.  
\vspace{0.2cm}

Rule-based anomaly detection suffers similar rigidity. Although such systems encode expert heuristics, they lack adaptability and require manual tuning whenever new devices or behaviours emerge. Given the dynamic nature of IoT deployments, these static systems rapidly lose relevance.

\subsection{Machine Learning and the Single-Task Constraint}
Machine-learning (ML) methods improve over rule-based systems by inferring complex decision boundaries from data. Techniques such as Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and early feedforward neural networks have demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing benign and malicious traffic. Nevertheless, their designs typically focus on a single analytic goal—either intrusion detection or device classification.  

This single-task paradigm presents several limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It ignores cross-task relationships; information about device identity can aid detection accuracy, while abnormal activity can flag compromised devices.
    \item Single-task models require complete retraining when the threat landscape changes, introducing downtime and resource overhead.
    \item Maintaining multiple models in production increases latency, memory usage, and orchestration complexity, which is impractical for resource-constrained IoT gateways.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Case for Multitask Deep Learning}
Deep learning has advanced intrusion detection by automating feature extraction from raw network traffic. Hybrid models that combine Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and recurrent or attention-based layers capture both spatial correlations and temporal dynamics. For instance, CNN–LSTM architectures have achieved detection accuracies above 98\% on benchmark datasets such as CICIoT 2023 by modelling spatial–temporal dependencies \parencite{Gueriani2024}. Transformers further extend this capability through self-attention, learning contextual dependencies across long traffic sequences \parencite{Ullah2023}.  
\vspace{0.2cm}

Multitask learning (MTL) generalises these ideas by sharing feature representations across related tasks. A single CNN–Transformer encoder can feed two lightweight heads: one for device identification and one for intrusion detection. MTL offers three major advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shared layers reduce redundant computation, improving inference speed and memory efficiency.
    \item  Shared inductive bias helps the model adapt to unseen devices or attack types.
    \item  A unified model simplifies deployment pipelines and monitoring.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Contribution and Integration into Cloud Environments}
Building on these insights, this research develops a cloud-deployed multitask CNN Transformer framework capable of simultaneous IoT device identification and intrusion detection. The model is trained and evaluated on the CIC IoT-IDAD 2024 dataset, which includes benign and attack flows across multiple IoT device classes and attack families.  
\vspace{0.2cm}

Key contributions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementing a multitask architecture optimised for accuracy and latency under realistic network workloads.
    \item Benchmarking against strong single-task baselines—XGBoost, BiLSTM, and TabNet—to quantify trade-offs in computational efficiency and scalability.
    \item Deploying the trained model as a containerised FastAPI microservice on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with automated CI/CD pipelines for reproducibility.
    \item Integrating Prometheus and Grafana for continuous observability and performance tracking in cloud production environments.
\end{itemize}

This approach bridges the gap between experimental ML research and production-grade IoT security systems.

\section{Problem Statement}
IoT infrastructures present distinct challenges relative to traditional networks. They consist of thousands of low-power devices—sensors, cameras, thermostats, or controllers—communicating asynchronously through heterogeneous protocols. Variations in manufacturer security practices, weak firmware validation, and limited encryption support exacerbate vulnerabilities. Firmware updates are inconsistent, leaving many devices susceptible to known exploits long after fixes exist.

Conventional IDS frameworks, designed for well-provisioned enterprise servers, do not scale down to these environments. Their assumptions of stable topology and uniform configuration fail in distributed IoT systems where devices may appear, disappear, or behave differently based on context. Attack vectors such as botnet recruitment, firmware manipulation, and side-channel exploitation require models that generalise beyond static signatures.

Furthermore, treating device identification and intrusion detection as separate functions doubles processing overhead. Independent models overlook the interdependence between device behaviour and threat manifestation. This redundancy increases latency and weakens detection sensitivity.

Most research still evaluates models offline on benchmark datasets, ignoring deployment realities. Few studies report inference latency, resource usage, or continuous monitoring metrics. As a result, promising prototypes remain laboratory artefacts, not deployable security solutions.

Hence, there is a critical need for a unified, scalable, and cloud-operational deep-learning framework that can perform both tasks concurrently, maintaining low latency, interpretability of performance metrics, and operational reliability.

\section{Research Aim}
The aim of this research is to develop and deploy a cloud-based multitask CNN Transformer framework that concurrently identifies IoT devices and detects intrusions, achieving high accuracy and low latency through a FastAPI microservice on AWS ECS with automated CI/CD and real-time monitoring.

\section{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Analyse and preprocess the CIC IoT-IDAD 2024 dataset to handle class imbalance and extract relevant flow-based features.  
    \item Design a multitask CNN Transformer with shared encoder and dual heads for IoT device identification and intrusion detection.  
    \item Train and evaluate the model against baselines (XGBoost, BiLSTM, TabNet) using accuracy, F1-score, and latency metrics.  
    \item Containerise the trained model as a FastAPI microservice and deploy it on AWS ECS with automated CI/CD pipelines.  
    \item Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring, scalability assessment, and performance validation.  
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope and Delimitations}

This research focuses on developing a cloud-deployed multitask deep learning framework capable of performing IoT device identification and intrusion detection simultaneously. The project scope has been defined to ensure academic depth, technical feasibility, and reproducibility within available resources.

\subsection{Dataset}

The study utilises the CIC IoT-IDAD 2024 dataset, a publicly available benchmark for IoT security research hosted by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity at the University of New Brunswick (\citeauthor{CIC2024}, \citeyear{CIC2024}). It contains flow-based network traffic generated from multiple IoT devices and includes both benign and attack samples across categories such as DDoS, DoS, Mirai, Spoofing, and Web-based intrusions (\citeauthor{Tseng2024}, \citeyear{Tseng2024}; \citeauthor{Laghari2024}, \citeyear{Laghari2024}). This dataset provides realistic, well-structured traffic suitable for supervised learning and reproducible experimentation. Proprietary, undisclosed, or synthetic datasets are excluded to maintain transparency and ensure open access for validation.

\subsection{Model Architecture}

The proposed framework employs a multitask CNN–Transformer model with a shared encoder and two task-specific heads for IoT device identification and intrusion detection. Comparative baselines include XGBoost, BiLSTM, and TabNet, allowing direct performance benchmarking across accuracy, latency, and computational efficiency metrics (\citeauthor{Gueriani2024}, \citeyear{Gueriani2024}; \citeauthor{Patil2025}, \citeyear{Patil2025}). Other complex architectures such as generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, large language models, graph neural networks, and federated learning are excluded due to time and resource constraints.

\subsection{Deployment}

The deployment scope covers containerisation using Docker, orchestration via AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) through GitHub Actions. The final model is exposed as a FastAPI microservice and monitored using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance insights (\citeauthor{Naayini2025}, \citeyear{Naayini2025}). Alternative edge or FPGA deployments and non-AWS platforms such as Azure or Google Cloud are excluded to maintain architectural consistency.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

Model evaluation follows established practices in network intrusion detection research, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, latency (mean and percentile), throughput, memory utilisation, and confusion matrices (\citeauthor{Nazir2025}, \citeyear{Nazir2025}). Metrics concerning energy efficiency, adversarial robustness, cost analysis, or formal verification are excluded but recognised as relevant for future work.

\subsection{Regulatory and Compliance Considerations}

The research considers privacy and data protection principles in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), ensuring ethical handling of network data and model outputs (\citeauthor{Pavlidis2024}, \citeyear{Pavlidis2024}; \citeauthor{Nolte2025}, \citeyear{Nolte2025}). However, full compliance audits or formal certifications (e.g., ISO 27001 or SOC 2) are outside the project’s academic remit.

This scoped design ensures a balanced and reproducible contribution by integrating deep learning, cloud deployment, and real-time monitoring into a unified operational framework for IoT security. It aligns with the academic standards of applied research while remaining feasible within the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at Dublin Business School.
