First and foremost, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude to my Dissertation Supervisor, 
\textbf{Dr. Syed Mustufa}, of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence programme at 
\textbf{Dublin Business School}. Dr. Mustufa was always willing to help whenever I encountered 
difficulties or had questions about my research or writing. He consistently ensured that my 
research work remained original and of a high academic standard. He also guided me whenever he 
identified issues in my methodology or writing and encouraged open discussion throughout the 
process. Every meeting with him was a valuable learning experience as he pushed me to explore 
new directions and think critically.
I would also like to express my appreciation to the teaching faculty at Dublin Business School 
for equipping me with the knowledge, tools, and technologies necessary to successfully complete 
this project.
Finally, I would like to extend heartfelt thanks to my family for their continuous support, 
encouragement, and patience throughout this journey.
